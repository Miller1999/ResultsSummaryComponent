## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This project has enabled me to refresh my understanding of fundamental tasks, such as importing JSON data, while also enhancing my proficiency with Styled-Components.



### Continued development

I employed minimal props drilling in this small project, as my primary aim was to concentrate on utilizing Context or Redux for future, more substantial projects

### Useful resources

- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev) - I chose to leverage this framework to boost my component's performance while also benefiting from its straightforward folder structure
- [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/docs) - I require this documentation to implement dynamic styling for my project.
